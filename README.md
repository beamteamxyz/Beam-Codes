# Beam-Codes
Platform for managing linked content behind QR and other visual codes.

Today, the purpose of Beam codes are to help consumers manage QR codes that are permanently imprinted onto their clothing and accessories such as t-shirts, hats, collars, nipple pasties and more. Because the imprinted codes are permanent, consumers need an easy self-managed tool to continually update the linked content behind their code.

Examples of linked content could include a TikTok, CashApp, Instagram, PayPal, YouTube or other internet service, or a hosted file such as a Contact Card (vCard) or other file types.
